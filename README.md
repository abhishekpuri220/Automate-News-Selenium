# Football News Scraper

This project is a web scraper built using Python and Selenium to scrape football news headlines from [The Sun's football section](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/). The scraper gathers the titles, subtitles, and links to the latest articles and saves the data into a CSV file.

## Features

- **Headless Browsing**: Uses Chrome in headless mode to scrape data without opening a browser window.
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Extracts article titles, subtitles, and URLs from the football news section.
- **CSV Output**: Saves the scraped data into a CSV file with a timestamp in the file name.
